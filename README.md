# Lettuce Greenhouse Production Control
Project for Advanced Machine Learning at Wageningen University 

Authors of the Project: Bart van Laatum; Congcong Sun 

Project Group Members: Eric Wiskandt and Logan Rower

Greenhouse model is derived from (Boersma & van Mourik, 2021). 

Objective:
- Utilize Reinforcement Learning Algorithms to control the indoor environmental conditions of a lettuce greenhouse with the goal of maximizing net profit.
